Hi  I'm Chris! I am someone who is deeply passionate about blending tech with creative solutions to make a positive impact. My journey is filled with various projects, from full-stack websites to image recognition models.
Outside the digital world, I'm an adventurer at heart â€” hiking, camping, training for triathlons, capturing the world through my camera, and constantly seeking inspiration from nature.
